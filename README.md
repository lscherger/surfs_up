# surfs_up
analysis of weather data for a future surf shop


## Overview of the analysis
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to use SQL Alchemy to connect Pandas and SQL to perform an analysis of weather data for a future surf shop. By connecting to a database, we can store the data, while still being able to perform session queries mapped to a specific point in the data using Python with Pandas. 

## Results
There is a bulleted list that addresses the three key differences in weather between June and December.
* Point 1: The minimum temperature for June is 64 F, and the minimum temperature for December is 56 F. 
* Point 2: The quartile markers are 73 F(25% or Q1), 75 F (50% or Q2) and 77 F(75% or Q3) for June, and 69 F (25% or Q1), 71 F (50% or Q2) and 74 F (75% or Q3) for December. These quart
